## Notes

Since I am very new to JavaScript and web dev, I had challenges figuring some updates. Also image classification could be improved. 
However, there are a lot of resources online and p5js documentation provides very good suggestions.
If this is your first time, you need a lot of patience and reading stack errors from the logcat to figure out which lines and which files should be debugged.
Feel free to comment and make improvements !!
